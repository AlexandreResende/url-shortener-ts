# url-shortener-ts

## Description

TLDR: URL shortener written in Typescript

The idea is to create a URL shortener using MongoDB, Postgres and Redis.  
Each one representing a cache/DB layer to test each one of them in three different branches.  
No benchmark will be provided for seeing which one is the best. The idea is to practice them.  

For redis the branch is:
>feature/redis
